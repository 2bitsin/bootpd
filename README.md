This is a DHCP/BOOTP + TFTP server to help with developing legacy PXE bootloaders.

Usage and configuration is pretty straight forward, please look at the example directory.

If more exaplanation is needed, please message me and I'll add some.

It is windows only for now, if other platforms are of interest to anyone, pull requests are welcome!
